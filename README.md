This project host a number of themes for the CATS editor. The themes were made into a seperate project 
so the download of the CATS editor itself stays small.

The images used in the various themes are all free and opensource as far as we could establish (based on 
the information from the various website we got them from). Please contact us if you think different 
about a praticular image.
